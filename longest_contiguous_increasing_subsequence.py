# Write a Python function that takes an unsorted array of integers and returns the longest contiguous increasing subsequence. 
# The function should run in O(n log n) time complexity.

#This program performs correctly and does not give any errors during the runtime but it as well does not adhere to the prompt requirements as the time complexity of the program does not follow what is mentioned in the prompt requirements.
#But this is the better response as it correctly computes and return the longest increasing contiguous subsequence even though the time complexity is not followed.
